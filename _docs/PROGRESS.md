---

## Session 2 — 2026-04-03

### Completed
- [x] Installed Node.js v24 via nvm (no sudo required)
- [x] Initialised Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind
- [x] Installed all dependencies: Supabase SSR, Anthropic SDK, Stripe, Resend, React Email, qrcode
- [x] Built `src/lib/` clients — Supabase (server + browser + admin), Anthropic, Stripe, Resend
- [x] Built `src/lib/anthropic/agent-runner.ts` — core tool-use loop for all agents
- [x] Built `src/middleware.ts` — auth protection + role-based route guards
- [x] Built `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` — OAuth/SAML callback with auto user creation + role assignment
- [x] Built `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` — handles checkout, refund, payment_failed events
- [x] Built `src/types/index.ts` — full TypeScript type definitions for all DB entities
- [x] Written `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` — all tables, RLS policies, indexes

### Next Steps (Session 3) — COMPLETED in same sitting

---

## Session 3 — 2026-04-03

### Completed
- [x] Created Supabase project (`neibpbkholgoypswyalx`)
- [x] Ran `001_initial_schema.sql` — all 9 tables created with RLS policies (fixed function-before-table ordering bug)
- [x] Created `.env.local` with Supabase URL, anon key, service role key
- [x] Fixed Next.js 16 `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` rename + export rename
- [x] Cleared `.next` cache and confirmed dev server starts clean
- [x] Homepage live at `http://localhost:3000` — SVU branding, three feature cards

### Decisions Made
- Supabase project region: closest to Melbourne (Sydney)
- Next.js version is 16.2.2 (newer than planned 14 — middleware is now called `proxy`)
- Dev server runs on port 3000

### Next Steps (Session 4) — COMPLETED in same sitting

---

## Session 4 — 2026-04-03

### Completed
- [x] Installed shadcn/ui v4.1.2 — init with Tailwind v4, added Button, Input, Label, Card components
- [x] Noted: shadcn now uses Base UI (`@base-ui/react/button`) not Radix — no `asChild` prop; use `render` prop or `buttonVariants` on Link directly
- [x] Built `/login` page — email magic link (Server Action + `useActionState`) + Google OAuth button
- [x] Built `/auth/callback` (already existed from session 2) — handles both OAuth code exchange and auto user-creation
- [x] Built `/admin/layout.tsx` — super_admin role guard, sidebar nav (Dashboard, Bookings, Events, Users, Maintenance, Reports)
- [x] Built `/admin/page.tsx` — stats cards (total bookings, pending, users, revenue MTD) + recent bookings table
- [x] Built `/admin/actions.ts` — signOut server action
- [x] Built `/staff/layout.tsx` — staff/super_admin role guard, sidebar with Admin Panel link for admins
- [x] Built `/staff/page.tsx` — personal booking dashboard split into upcoming / past
- [x] Built `/staff/book/page.tsx` + `booking-form.tsx` — full booking request form (type selector, title, description, date/time, duration, attendee count)
- [x] Built `/staff/book/actions.ts` — `createBookingRequest` server action inserts booking and redirects to confirm
- [x] Built `/staff/book/confirm/page.tsx` — post-submission confirmation page showing booking details
- [x] TypeScript check: 0 errors

### Decisions Made
- shadcn/ui v4 uses Base UI buttons — `asChild` is not available; use `buttonVariants` + `<Link>` for navigation buttons
- `useActionState` requires server action signature `(prevState, formData)` — added `_prevState` param to all actions
- `signInWithGoogle` redirects on both success and failure (no error object return) so it satisfies `() => Promise<void>` for form action type

### Next Steps (Session 5) — COMPLETED

---

## Session 5 — 2026-04-06

### Completed

#### Public-facing pages
- [x] Built `/events` — public events listing with date, tickets-left, Humanitix integration
- [x] Built `/events/[id]/tickets` — Stripe ticket checkout (quantity selector, capacity check, redirect to Stripe)
- [x] Built `/events/[id]/tickets/success` — post-purchase confirmation page
- [x] Built `/school-groups` — full educational visits page (programs, how-it-works, CTA)
- [x] Built `/enquire` — private hire enquiry form with `EnquiryForm` client component
- [x] Built `/staff/register` — staff access request form (name, email, reason; pending review flow)
- [x] Updated homepage — parallax hero, saturn scroll-scrub animation, 4 full photo sections (events, schools, hire, future), footer

#### Auth
- [x] Built `/auth/confirm` — client-side magic link token handler (sets session from URL fragment, creates user record, redirects)
- [x] Built `/auth/set-password` — password setup page for invited users

#### Staff portal
- [x] Built `/staff/book/calendar.tsx` — visual calendar date picker in booking form
- [x] Built `/staff/bookings/[id]/edit` — edit pending bookings (form + server action)
- [x] Built `cancel-booking-button.tsx` — client component for cancelling bookings from dashboard

#### Admin panel — heavily expanded
- [x] Rebuilt `/admin/page.tsx` — single long-scroll dashboard with all sections: Bookings calendar, Overview stats, Staff Requests, Events, Enquiries, Check-in, Users, Broadcast
- [x] Built `/admin/bookings/admin-calendar.tsx` — full interactive weekly calendar with approve/reject/edit/delete/bulk-select/create/block-dates modals
- [x] Built `/admin/bookings/actions.ts` — approve, reject, delete, bulk approve/delete, adminCreateBooking, adminUpdateBooking, adminUpdateAllByTitle, blockDates, email notifications on approve/reject
- [x] Built `/admin/events/page.tsx` — events list with attendance tracking, guest list download, duplicate, edit, publish status
- [x] Built `/admin/events/new` — create event form with image upload to Supabase Storage
- [x] Built `/admin/events/[id]/edit` — edit event form
- [x] Built `/admin/events/duplicate-button.tsx` — one-click event duplication
- [x] Built `/admin/enquiries/page.tsx` — expandable enquiry cards with status selector, reply-by-email link
- [x] Built `/admin/checkin/page.tsx` + `qr-scanner.tsx` — QR code scanner for event check-in (webcam + manual code)
- [x] Built `/admin/broadcast/broadcast-form.tsx` — email broadcast to all confirmed-booking staff in a date range
- [x] Built `/admin/staff-requests/page.tsx` + `actions.ts` — approve (sends Supabase invite) / reject staff access requests
- [x] Built `/admin/users/role-selector.tsx`, `delete-button.tsx`, `invite-staff.tsx` — inline role management and user deletion

#### API routes
- [x] Built `/api/checkout` — Stripe checkout session creation (validates capacity, builds line items, returns session URL)
- [x] Built `/api/reserve` — ticket reservation before checkout
- [x] Built `/api/qr/[code]` — QR code lookup for check-in (returns ticket + event details)
- [x] Built `/api/cron/booking-reminders` — automated 24h reminder emails to staff with upcoming confirmed bookings
- [x] Built `/api/admin/reports/attendance` — CSV attendance report across all events
- [x] Built `/api/admin/events/[id]/guests` — per-event guest list CSV export

#### Database migrations
- [x] `002_bookings_datetime.sql` — datetime column adjustments
- [x] `003_enquiries.sql` — enquiries table
- [x] `004_events_humanitix_url.sql` — Humanitix URL field on events
- [x] `005_qr_storage.sql` — QR code storage setup
- [x] `006_staff_requests.sql` — staff access request table
- [x] `007_event_image_url.sql` — image URL field on events
- [x] `008_vip_booking_type.sql` — VIP booking type enum value

### Decisions Made
- Magic link auth uses `/auth/confirm` (client-side) to handle URL fragment tokens — server-side can't read hash params
- Admin dashboard is a single scrollable page with anchored sections, not separate sub-pages (better for daily ops workflow)
- Booking calendar uses a weekly view with inline modals — no navigation to separate page required
- `blockDates` creates one `confirmed` booking per day in the range with `booking_type: 'maintenance'` — reuses existing bookings table
- Ticket checkout uses Stripe redirect (not embedded) — simpler, PCI-compliant
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` env var controls who gets `super_admin` role on first sign-in

### Remaining / Not Started
- [ ] `/admin/reports` — placeholder only ("Coming soon")
- [ ] `/admin/maintenance` — placeholder only ("Coming soon")
- [ ] `agents/` directory — completely empty; `agent-runner.ts` framework exists but no agents implemented
- [ ] `emails/` directory — empty; no React Email templates built yet
- [ ] SAML 2.0 SSO — blocked on Swinburne IT
- [ ] Conflict detection in `createBookingRequest` — not yet added
- [ ] React Email templates — booking confirmed, booking declined, ticket purchase, event reminder

---

## Session 6 — 2026-04-07

### Completed

#### Admin panel
- [x] Admin landing page consolidated into one giant scrollable dashboard (calendar at top, then Overview, Staff Requests, Events, Enquiries, Check-in, Users, Broadcast below)
- [x] Sidebar nav updated to anchor links (`/admin#bookings`, `#overview`, etc.) — no separate tabs
- [x] `/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` created as a standalone route (dead — not in nav, kept for reference)
- [x] Admin recent bookings list: inline Approve/Reject buttons for pending bookings
- [x] Admin booking calendar: calendar height uses `calc(100vh - 120px)` to fill viewport within scrollable page
- [x] Event max capacity limit raised from 60 → 100 in both new and edit event forms

#### Calendar improvements (both admin + staff)
- [x] Calendar always starts on Monday regardless of current day
- [x] Day headers moved inside the scroll container as `sticky top-0` — fixes misalignment caused by scrollbar width stealing space from columns
- [x] Calendar time range changed from 08:00–20:00 to 06:00–24:00; last label shows `00:00` not `24:00`
- [x] Click-and-drag on day columns to pre-select a time range before opening the new booking panel
- [x] `data-booking-block` attribute prevents drag from triggering when clicking existing booking blocks

#### Booking types & time display
- [x] Added `SVU Demo` booking type to all dropdowns (staff calendar, admin calendar, edit booking form)
- [x] Added `009_svu_demo_booking_type.sql` migration to update DB check constraint
- [x] Replaced all `<input type="time">` with custom `TimeSelect` component (`src/components/ui/time-select.tsx`) — two `<select>` elements for 00–23 hours and 00/15/30/45 minutes; guaranteed 24h on all browsers/OS

#### Public events on calendar
- [x] Published events from the `events` table auto-appear on both admin and staff calendars
- [x] Events rendered in orange (`public_event` colour), positioned from `event_date + start_time/end_time`
- [x] Admin calendar: clicking an event opens a read-only `EventDetailPanel` with "Manage events →" link
- [x] Staff calendar: event blocks are non-interactive (cursor default, click does nothing)
- [x] Events are non-draggable and excluded from bulk select

#### Bug fixes
- [x] Timezone bug: `getWeekBookings` and `getAdminWeekBookings` now pass `weekStart.toISOString()` instead of bare date string — fixes bookings disappearing due to UTC midnight vs local midnight mismatch
- [x] `src/app/staff/actions.ts` missing from prior commit — added `cancelSeries` export
- [x] `src/app/staff/book/page.tsx` was a plain client component missing `currentUserId` prop — converted to async server component that fetches the user profile

### Decisions Made
- Single scrollable admin dashboard preferred over tabbed layout (user preference)
- `TimeSelect` custom component is the only reliable cross-browser 24h time input on Windows/Chrome with Australian locale
- Events use `id: 'event_${uuid}'` prefix to avoid ID collision with booking UUIDs
- `source: 'booking' | 'event'` field added to `Booking` type to distinguish event blocks from real bookings

---

## Session 7 — 2026-04-08

### Completed

#### Mobile responsiveness (full pass)
- [x] Staff + admin booking calendars: auto-switch to 3-day view on mobile (`window.innerWidth < 768`)
- [x] Touch events (`onTouchStart`/`onTouchEnd`) on calendar day columns for mobile booking
- [x] Calendar nav arrows: hidden in toolbar on mobile, replaced by fixed bottom arrow bar (`position: fixed, bottom-16`) with large tap targets (`w-8 h-8 px-8`)
- [x] Bottom tab bar (`StaffBottomNav`) — mobile-only (`md:hidden`), fixed above device chrome, tabs: Calendar / Check-in / Admin (super_admin only, red tint), Profile avatar far-right
- [x] Sidebar converted to hamburger drawer on mobile; desktop sidebar remains resizable via drag handle
- [x] `pb-28 md:pb-0` on time grid to prevent content hiding behind fixed bars

#### QR scanner redesign
- [x] Camera stops immediately on scan (`stopScanner()` called inside `handleCode`)
- [x] Result card: coloured banner (emerald/amber/red) + guest name, ticket count, event + session time, already-scanned warning
- [x] "Scan next ticket" button restarts camera
- [x] `TallyBar` — fixed bar (`bottom-16`, above tab nav), always visible in all states, shows: `{checkedIn} in | {sold} sold [progress bar] {pct}%`
- [x] Tally counts ticket quantities (`.reduce` sum), not row count — fixes multi-ticket undercounting
- [x] Tally persists across scans; re-fetches after successful check-in for accurate count
- [x] Camera capped at `max-h-[45vh]` so result fits without scrolling

#### Ticket check-in: correct buyer name
- [x] Added `buyer_name` column to `tickets` table (`012_tickets_buyer_name.sql`)
- [x] Free ticket (`/api/reserve`): stores `buyer_name: name` from the form
- [x] Paid ticket (Stripe webhook): stores name from form via metadata (`session.metadata.buyer_name`), with fallbacks to `session.customer_details.name` then `payment_method.billing_details.name`
- [x] Checkout route passes `name` and `email` from form body into Stripe session metadata and `customer_email`
- [x] Check-in action reads `buyer_name` first; falls back to `users.full_name` only if null
- [x] `CheckInResult` type includes `eventDate`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `quantity`, `tally`

#### Ticket cancellation fix
- [x] Cancel form was fetching `/api/tickets/cancel` without `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` prefix — caused a JSON parse error masquerading as "Network error"
- [x] Fixed: `const base = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH ?? ''` added to `cancel-form.tsx`

#### Infrastructure
- [x] Vercel, Supabase, and Resend all live and confirmed working as of this session
- [x] Staff check-in page (`/staff/checkin`) added — reuses admin `QrScanner` component

### Decisions Made
- `buyer_name` on tickets is the authoritative display name at check-in — account `full_name` is only a fallback
- Name flows: form input → API route → Stripe metadata → webhook → DB (not relying on Stripe's own name collection)
- All client-side `fetch` calls must prefix with `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH ?? ''` — enforced across all routes now

### Remaining / Not Started
- [ ] `/admin/reports` — placeholder only ("Coming soon")
- [ ] `/admin/maintenance` — placeholder only ("Coming soon")
- [ ] `agents/` directory — framework exists but no agents implemented
- [ ] `emails/` directory — no React Email templates built yet
- [ ] SAML 2.0 SSO — blocked on Swinburne IT
- [ ] Conflict detection in `createBookingRequest`
- [ ] Google Calendar integration

---

---

## Session 8 — 2026-04-09

### Completed

#### Email deliverability investigation + fixes
- [x] Diagnosed ticket emails not arriving at Hotmail and @swin.edu.au addresses
- [x] Confirmed via Resend SMTP log: emails ARE being delivered (250 response from `ausprd01.prod.outlook.com`) — problem is spam filtering, not sending failure
- [x] Root cause: `svu3d.ai` is a new domain with no sender reputation; Microsoft/Swinburne Exchange puts it in Junk
- [x] Added plain-text `text:` body to all 7 email-sending files (spam filters penalise HTML-only emails)
- [x] Added `List-Unsubscribe` + `List-Unsubscribe-Post` + `Precedence: bulk` headers to broadcast emails
- [x] Added `tags` to all emails for Resend dashboard tracking by type
- [x] TypeScript check: 0 errors

#### Files changed
- `src/lib/email/send-ticket-confirmation.ts`
- `src/app/admin/bookings/actions.ts`
- `src/app/api/cron/booking-reminders/route.ts`
- `src/app/admin/broadcast/actions.ts`
- `src/app/admin/staff-requests/actions.ts`
- `src/app/enquire/actions.ts`
- `src/app/staff/register/actions.ts`

### Decisions Made
- Plain-text email body is now mandatory alongside HTML for all sends — spam filter requirement
- Broadcast emails get bulk mail headers; transactional emails do not

### Remaining / Needs Carl's action (not code)
- [ ] **Resend dashboard → Domains → `svu3d.ai`** — verify all three DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) are green. DKIM especially is the key fix for Hotmail long-term
- [ ] **Add DMARC record** to DNS: `_dmarc.svu3d.ai` TXT → `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:cknox@swin.edu.au`
- [ ] **Register with Microsoft SNDS** at sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/ to improve Hotmail/Outlook.com reputation
- [ ] **Ask @swin.edu.au recipients** to check Junk folder, mark as Not Junk, add `bookings@svu3d.ai` to Safe Senders
- [ ] **`dianayousry@hotmail.com`** — never appeared in Resend logs; unclear if she purchased with hotmail or swin address. Needs investigation
- [ ] **Test send investigation** — last test (carlknox@gmail.com "just now") didn't appear in Resend list; needs retest after lunch to confirm email fires on purchase

### Remaining / Not Started
- [ ] `/admin/reports` — placeholder only ("Coming soon")
- [ ] `/admin/maintenance` — placeholder only ("Coming soon")
- [ ] `agents/` directory — framework exists but no agents implemented
- [ ] `emails/` directory — no React Email templates built yet
- [ ] SAML 2.0 SSO — blocked on Swinburne IT
- [ ] Conflict detection in `createBookingRequest`
- [ ] Google Calendar integration

---

## Session 9 — 2026-04-13

### Completed

#### Ticket buttons — "Coming soon" mode
- [x] Replaced "Get tickets" links with "Coming soon" placeholder on homepage, events listing, and ticket page
- [x] Homepage hero button changed from `<Link>` to dimmed `<span>` (no navigation)
- [x] Events listing: events WITH an Eventbrite URL show "Get tickets" (links externally); events without show "Coming soon"
- [x] Currently ALL buttons set to "Coming soon" — to go live, restore the `humanitix_url` conditional in `src/app/events/page.tsx` (see "How to go live" below)

#### Eventbrite integration
- [x] Created Eventbrite pages for 3 of 4 sessions
- [x] Stored Eventbrite URLs in `humanitix_url` field on events table in Supabase (ready to use)
- [x] Session 4 remains unpublished (private link only)
- [x] Removed `is_published` filter from `/events/[id]/tickets/page.tsx` so unpublished events can be accessed via direct link
- [x] Removed ticket counter ("X tickets left") from events listing — capacity managed on Eventbrite
- [x] Added start–end time display (e.g. 12:00 – 12:45) on events listing

#### Eventbrite URLs stored in DB (ready to activate)
| Session | Time | Eventbrite URL |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Session 1 | 12:00–12:45 | `https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/svu-open-day-tickets-1987296014877?aff=oddtdtcreator` |
| Session 2 | 13:00–13:45 | `https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/svu-open-day-tickets-1987297229510?aff=oddtdtcreator` |
| Session 3 | 14:00–14:45 | `https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/svu-open-day-session-3-tickets-1987299517353?aff=oddtdtcreator` |
| Session 4 | 15:00–15:45 | Not yet created — event is unpublished |

#### How to go live with ticket buttons
In `src/app/events/page.tsx`, replace the "Coming soon" `<span>` block with:
```jsx
{!soldOut && (
  event.humanitix_url ? (
    <a href={event.humanitix_url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
       className="flex-shrink-0 rounded-xl bg-swin-red px-4 py-2 text-[13px] font-semibold text-white hover:bg-swin-red-hover transition-all duration-200">
      Get tickets
    </a>
  ) : (
    <span className="flex-shrink-0 rounded-xl bg-white/20 px-4 py-2 text-[13px] font-semibold text-white/60 cursor-default">
      Coming soon
    </span>
  )
)}
```

#### Email deliverability
- [x] Confirmed: Resend sends successfully (green status), Gmail receives fine, but Swinburne Exchange silently drops emails from `svu3d.ai`
- [x] Added `carlknox@gmail.com` as second recipient on enquiry notification emails as workaround
- [x] DNS: SPF and DKIM verified in GoDaddy for `svu3d.ai`; DMARC record still needs adding (GoDaddy validation issue)
- [x] Domain DNS managed by GoDaddy (nameservers: `ns11.domaincontrol.com`, `ns12.domaincontrol.com`)

#### Login page
- [x] Removed "Continue with Google" OAuth button — staff login is email/password only (swin.edu.au staff)

### Decisions Made
- Public ticketing moved to Eventbrite instead of built-in Stripe checkout — avoids email deliverability issues with new domain
- `humanitix_url` DB field reused for Eventbrite URLs (field name is legacy but functional)
- Enquiry emails sent to both `cknox@swin.edu.au` and `carlknox@gmail.com` until Swinburne whitelists domain
- Google OAuth removed from staff login — only @swin.edu.au staff should have access

### Remaining / Needs Carl's action (not code)
- [ ] Add DMARC TXT record in GoDaddy: Name `_dmarc`, Value `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:cknox@swin.edu.au` (GoDaddy rejected — may need to contact GoDaddy support)
- [ ] Contact Swinburne IT to whitelist `svu3d.ai` / `bookings@svu3d.ai` in Exchange
- [ ] Create Eventbrite page for Session 4 (if needed) and provide URL
- [ ] Register with Microsoft SNDS for Hotmail/Outlook.com reputation

### Remaining / Not Started
- [ ] `/admin/reports` — placeholder only ("Coming soon")
- [ ] `/admin/maintenance` — placeholder only ("Coming soon")
- [ ] `agents/` directory — framework exists but no agents implemented
- [ ] `emails/` directory — no React Email templates built yet
- [ ] SAML 2.0 SSO — blocked on Swinburne IT
- [ ] Conflict detection in `createBookingRequest`
- [ ] Google Calendar integration
- [ ] Re-enable homepage "Get tickets" hero button (currently "Coming soon" `<span>`)

---

## Session 10 — 2026-04-24

### Completed

#### Live ticket availability from Eventbrite
- [x] Built `src/lib/eventbrite/client.ts` — `extractEventIdFromUrl` + `getTicketAvailability` (60s `next: { revalidate }` cache, degrades to `null` on missing token / URL / API error)
- [x] Extracts numeric event ID from the trailing segment of the Eventbrite URL (e.g. `...-1987296014877`) — no DB change required
- [x] Sums `quantity_total − quantity_sold` across non-hidden ticket classes via `GET /v3/events/{id}/ticket_classes/`
- [x] `/events` listing: shows "X of Y tickets left" next to price (red when ≤10 remaining); replaces the "Get tickets" button with a "Sold out" badge when availability hits 0
- [x] `/events/[id]/tickets`: detail page "Tickets" row now reads from Eventbrite instead of `tickets_sold` (which isn't being updated since the move off built-in Stripe)
- [x] Both pages fall back silently to DB counts when the token is missing — safe to ship before token is set
- [x] Added `EVENTBRITE_PRIVATE_TOKEN` to `.env.example` with link to the API-keys page
- [x] Verified live against the production API: Session 1 = 71/110 left, Session 2 = 103/110 left, Session 3 = 24/110 left

#### Ticket lookup side quest
- [x] Bec Fowler (`r_miers@hotmail.com`) found: 4 tickets, Session 1 (2 May 12:00–12:45), active, booked 12 Apr
- [x] Akshita Raina (`akshitaraina005@gmail.com`) found: 1 ticket, Session 1, active, booked 13 Apr
- [x] Both bookings were on the old built-in Stripe flow (stored in `tickets` table). Need re-booking on Eventbrite for the relocated session.

### Decisions Made
- Eventbrite API called **server-side only**, with a 60s Next.js `revalidate` cache, so token never reaches the browser and the API isn't hammered on every request
- `EVENTBRITE_PRIVATE_TOKEN` is server-only (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`)
- Numeric-suffix URL parser accepts any `-<10+ digits>` segment — works for both the current URL shapes (`svu-open-day-tickets-...` and `swinburnes-virtual-universe-exclusive-public-opening-show-tickets-...`)
- No schema change — Eventbrite event ID is derived from `events.humanitix_url` at request time
- Session 3's Eventbrite URL changed at some point (DB now holds `...1987873639568`, previously `...1987299517353`) — current code reads whatever's in the DB so it kept working

### Remaining / Needs Carl's action (not code)
- [x] Re-book Bec Fowler (4 tix) and Akshita Raina (1 tix) — Carl re-booked under each buyer's email and sent them notification emails (post-session)
- [ ] Create Session 4 Eventbrite page if you want it on the public listing (otherwise it stays unpublished and hidden)
- [ ] Existing items from Session 9 still open: DMARC DNS, Swinburne Exchange whitelist, Microsoft SNDS registration

### Remaining / Not Started
- [ ] `/admin/reports` — placeholder only
- [ ] `/admin/maintenance` — placeholder only
- [ ] `/admin/tickets` search page (would replace "ask Claude to run a script") — possible next session
- [ ] `agents/` directory — framework exists but no agents implemented
- [ ] `emails/` directory — no React Email templates built yet
- [ ] SAML 2.0 SSO — blocked on Swinburne IT
- [ ] Conflict detection in `createBookingRequest`
